# Burgertijd

## About this project

This project is made with ReactJS

I made this project with a co-student.
You can add ingredients you want with your burger and the total price will be written at the bottom of the screen.

The functionality is there, but it still needs some styling.

## Install

    $ git clone https://github.com/stefanreusens/Burgertijd
    $ cd Burgertijd/
    $ npm install
    $ npm start
